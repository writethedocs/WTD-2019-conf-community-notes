# Notes from session run by @mjang, taken by @adamaltman

Notes from the API Docs unconference (table 1) with @mikejang:

1. A couple people use postman pro and like it.  They thought it was easy to use, setup docs within the postman and publish to git.  One person had a problem that it publishes to git as a single line of JSON.  One person was able to establish a relationship with the CEO, and found them responsive to feature requests.
2. One person uses widdershins / slate to publish the docs.  It was a bit of work to setup but works smoothly now.
3. One uses Doxygen (and has a SOAP API).  Doxygen has a long conf file, but this person was able to self-learn it and could make changes and was able to style the output (and use something called comments).
4. People noted a struggle of when you have to support both SOAP and REST API docs.
5. Tutorials: people are mainly using separate docs for that.  (I mentioned we have a product we're going to release that allows you to "reference" your API specs from contextual docs... perhaps will have an unconference to preview that labeled Redocly Portal).
6. ADE (an acronym we all should learn:  API Development Environment.)  Everyone had used Postman, also check out insomnia.
7. One person used Stoplight and thought it was easy to paste yaml in, edit, and save (export).  They have some other workflow that required some engineering to do something with s3.
8. One person uses and does not recommend Modx.  The build pipeline sounds complex, using artifactory, and layering on some customer license/authentication part.
