# Notes from session run by @verythorough, taken by Esti Koen

intros: what we do and why we are here

tools mentioned: swagger, openapi, slate, markdown, static vs dynamic site generators, redoc, shins (static doc).

we want to know more about: doc/dev workflows, migration from confluence, getting started with api docs i.e. automation

api specs: where do they reside and who edits them? dev only, writer only, or   partnership and trust

spec writing approaches: implementation first vs. docs first.  docs first best  approach but requires planning/time/mgmt buy in.

helpful resource: i'd rather be writing (website, seminars, labs)

approaches to learn what a command does: run it, test cases, source code, talk  to SME, manage test code in docs

want to talk more: manage source code snippets
